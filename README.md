[KC Weather App](https://kc-7.github.io/kc-weather-app/) was designed to allow the user to enter multiple different locations and compare realtime weather data.

The app was built to refresh myself on core JavaScript concepts. The site is structed with HTML and styled using CSS. 

The Open Weather API is used to get the weather results. It is imported from the creds.json file which is not uploaded to GitHub.

I utilised the information I learned from the Code Institute alongside ChatGPT requests to create and customise this project.
